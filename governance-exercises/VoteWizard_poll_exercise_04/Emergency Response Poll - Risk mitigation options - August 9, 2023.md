# Poll: Emergency Response Poll - Risk mitigation options - August 9, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of a Protocol Scope Facilitator. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for 5 hours beginning on Wednesday, August 9 at 10:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

# Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support for one of the following options that will be added to an emergency executive proposal to mitigate the risk of a potential exploit:

* Fix B
* Fix B and Fix A

Please review the descriptions of the two possible fixes:

## Fix A

- Fix A prevents the high-severity exploit immediately upon the executive vote passing.
- Fix A is likely to incur losses to MKR holders of approximately 20 million DAI over two weeks.

## Fix B

- Fix B closes the high-severity exploit approximately two weeks after the executive vote passes.
- Fix B has no risk of incurring financial loss to MKR holders.

## Additional Information

[Information further elaborated and assessed by the ecosystem expert]

Note that Fix B will be included in the executive regardless of the approved option.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/...) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

# Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Fix B' option exceed the votes for the 'Fix B and Fix A' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Fix B will be added to the next executive to mitigate the potential exploit.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within one hour of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'Fix B and Fix A' option exceed the votes for the 'Fix B' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Fix B and Fix A will be added to the next executive to mitigate the potential exploit.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within one hour of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.
