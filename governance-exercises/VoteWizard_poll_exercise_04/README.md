# VoteWizard Polling Exericse #4

## Assignment #1: Determine what course of action you would take as a Governance Facilitator and communicate it clearly.

### The course of action I would take as a Governance Facilitator:

In accordance with the Emergency Response MIP24, my immediate step would be to assemble the relevant Ecosystem actors in a chat room for streamlined communication. Simultaneously, I'd engage with ADs and large MKR holders to ensure that the emergency executive will be passed as quickly as possible.

While I'd steer clear of technical conjectures, leaving them to the domain of protocol scope and technical ecosystem experts, I'd pose the following questions:

1- Would the executive's spell code containing only Fix B inadvertently reveal the exploit to potential attackers? If so, Fix A might be the more prudent route. I trust this angle has already been explored.

2- What's the maximum financial exposure? Understanding this is crucial to gauge if a 20 million Dai remediation cost is justifiable. For instance, if the vulnerable amount is 22 million Dai, spending 20 million might not be optimal. To make an informed decision, I'd seek insights from the Stability Scope Advisory Council, the risk core unit, or another appropriate actor like monet-supply.

3- What are the odds of conditions becoming favorable for someone to exploit the vulnerability? This metric can guide the decision-making process.

In response to Henrik's concerns, I'd invite him to articulate his reservations regarding offering Fix A to governance, encouraging him to voice his perspective in the group chat for collective brainstorming.

After this investigation, I' would post on the forum, confirming this is an emergency situation based on mip24 and let everyone know a poll is coming up.

At the same time, I would start working on the poll copy.

For this exercise, let's assume I received additional information from the ecosystem actor I approached, and both the protocol facilitator and technical ecosystem actors approved its inclusion in the poll. I'd also request that they share this information on the forum, allowing voters to be informed before the poll is created.

I would create the emergency poll, incorporating the information I've collected.

After confirming the poll is active, I'd announce it on the forum, discord, and reach out to ADs and token holders. I'd allow a 5-hour window for the poll, given that I've already alerted the delegates and token holders to participate but I would ask RoundTable to make sure if it matches with the ETA of the spell.

I'd stay in communication with MKR holders and ADs to ensure they're prepared to vote on the executive. Meanwhile, I'd begin drafting the executive content, so it's set to go once an option is chosen.

## Assignment #2: Draft any forum responses required or implied by your course of action

###  Response #1

Confirming that we are treating this as an Emergency situation as per [MIP24](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP24) due to funds at risk.

The governance facilitators, relevant Core Units and ecosystem actors have been in communication for the past few hours and continue to be so throughout the day.

The governance facilitators will keep in touch with ADs and other known large holders throughout today as we approach the time of the vote to ensure that an emergency executive will be passed as quickly as possible.

###  Response #2

Emergency sentiment poll is live on the voting portal - [title of the poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/...)

Please review and vote for one of the options.
