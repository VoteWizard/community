# Poll: Adjust Spork D3M Parameters and DAI Interest Rate Strategy - July 24, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of Spork Protocol. The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to using the Spork Direct Deposit DAI Module (D3M) with the listed parameters. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 24 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to making the following parameter changes to the Spork DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) and Interest Rate Strategy:
* Increase the DIRECT-Spork-DAI [Maximum Debt Ceiling](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) from 50 million to **100 million DAI**.
* Increase the DIRECT-Spork-DAI [Target Available Debt](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap) from 5 million to **15 million DAI**.
* Increase the DIRECT-Spork-DAI [Ceiling Increase Cooldown](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#ceiling-increase-cooldown-ttl) from 28,800 seconds (8 hours) to **86,400 seconds (24 hours)**.
* Adjust Spork Protocol DAI Interest Rate Strategy to increase the DAI deposit rate on Spork from 2% to 2.5%.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These parameter changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
