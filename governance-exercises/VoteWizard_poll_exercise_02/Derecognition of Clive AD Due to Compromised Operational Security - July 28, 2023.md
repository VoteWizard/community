# Poll: Derecognition of Clive AD due to compromised operational security - JULY 28, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) has been posted as per [MIP106c2.6.6.2.1A](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP106#6-6-current-incubating-ecosystem-actors) and will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 28 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the potential derecognition of Clive AD due to compromised operational security.
Materials posted by a community member, Diane, claim that they could reveal the delegate's identity. As per the [Atlas](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy), if these materials constitute significant suspicion, then the aligned delegate has to be derecognized.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/...) and the materials provided by Diane in [this post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/...) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* The Aligned Delegate will be derecognized.
* Half of the Aligned Delegate Buffer will be confiscated and used as the whistleblower bounty.
* The whistleblower bounty payment to Diane will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent any external factors.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
