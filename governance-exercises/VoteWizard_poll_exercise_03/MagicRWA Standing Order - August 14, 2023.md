# Poll: MagicRWA Standing Order - August 14, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 14 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

MKR Token Holders may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes in the MagicRWA Standing Order:
* The MagicRWA [current standing order](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/hash1) will be invalidated and replaced by the standing order in this [IPFS link](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/hash2).

In summary, the proposed change will authorize trustees of MagicRWA to manage quarterly RWA revenue transfers from their vaults via the conduit and jar contract and incorporate the new ALM transfer mechanism within this standing order.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/...) and the [standing order document](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/hash2) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option, then the following actions will be taken:**
* This standing order change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option, then no further action will be taken at this time.**
